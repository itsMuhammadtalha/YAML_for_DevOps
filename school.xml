    xml : extensive markup language 
    xml is not readable by the humans so we have to provide some version and encoding of the character

    Now we have a sample data and we want to represent the it in xml file which is basically serialization

    we have a school. the school has the following attributes "name" "princial" "and students"

    the students further have the following attributes "name" "roll no" "marks"
